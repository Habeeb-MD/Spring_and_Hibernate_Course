# 🟪 Introduction

* These are my notes from a Udemy course from Chad Darby, the course is entitled as 'Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 & Hibernate for Beginners' ([https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial/](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial/))
* I began this course on 26/03/2023 in order to familiarise myself with the Spring framework to help me with my new job!

* I created a basic Spring Boot REST API application which would communicate with a 🐬MySQL Database🐬
* The application would handle HTTP request which would do basic CRUD operations on an Employee table in the database
